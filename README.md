# Training

Heavily inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/retail-store-item-detection-using-yolov5-7ba3ddd71b0c) and this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thedatasith/visualize-sku110k/notebook), but applied to YOLOv8 instead of YOLOv5.

Training data is taken from the SKU110k dataset ([download from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedatasith/sku110k-annotations), which holds several gigabytes of prelabeled images of the subject matter.
