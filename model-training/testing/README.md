# Testing

Testing the models using som esample code.

## About

Utilize the converted models from the `..\model` folder.


## Tutorial

To run:

`python3 video_object_detection.py` for video

`python3 image_object_detection.py` for image

`python3 webcam_object_detection.py` for webcamÂ 


A image and video are already preloaded. The video just takes a youtube link and the image takes a image url I found on google. Pretty self explanatory when you look at it.
